RESTHeart is a open source runtime which embeds [Undertow](https://undertow.io), a flexible performant web server written in Java, providing both blocking and non-blocking APIâ€™s based on NIO. 

RESTHeart connects automatically to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) or any compatible database (e.g. Percona Server for MongoDB, AWS DocumentDB and Azure Cosmos DB) exposing all database's features through a comprehensive REST API. 

Additionally, the [GraphQL](https://restheart.org/docs/graphql/) plugin works side by side with the already existing REST endpoints to get a managed, unified GraphQL API for modern applications. 

The embeded WebSocket server can then expose MongoDB's [Change Streams](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/), which allow applications to access real-time data changes.

RESTHeart fully supports [GraalVM](https://restheart.org/docs/graalvm/), a new virtual machine from Oracle that offers a polyglot runtime environment and the ability to compile Java applications to __native binary images__.

RESTHeart __works out-of-the-box__ by merely installing and configuring it, but you can easily extend it by developing custom [plugins](https://restheart.org/docs/plugins/overview/).

For all these reasons, __RESTHeart is the perfect low code backend for most modern Web and Mobile apps__, designed to radically simplify development and deployment.

In summary, RESTHeart provides:

1. Polyglot Development Framework supporting Java, Kotlin, JavaScript and TypeScript.
2. Data persistence on MongoDB with REST, GraphQL and WebSocket APIs.
3. Authentication, authorization and user management for your applications.

__NOTE__: RESTHeart is also available as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/softinstigate/restheart). It works perfectly in Kubernetes and AWS ECS clusters.

## Download

Download prebuilt packages from [releases](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/releases)

Find setup instructions at [Setup](https://restheart.org/docs/setup/) documentation page.

## Build from source

__NOTE__: Building RESTHeart 6+ requires JDK 16!

```bash
$ mvn clean package
```

You can then run it with (make sure to have mongod running):
