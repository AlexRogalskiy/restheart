## Introduction

RESTHeart is the most popular **REST API** for **MongoDB**. All MongoDB's capabilities can be automatically accessed via a complete REST API.

RESTHeart provides out-of-the-box:

1. Data persistence via MongoDB.
1. Secure Identity and Access Management.
1. Complete REST API with JSON messages.

RESTHeart is a modern backend for Web and Mobile apps, designed to radically simplify server-side development and deployment. 

RESTHeart comes with complete functionalities out of the box, but you can extend it with Java to implement custom services.

## Documentation

The full documentation is available [here](https://restheart.org/docs/).
