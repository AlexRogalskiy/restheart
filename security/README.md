# RESTHeart Security

**restheart-security** is the security module for RESTHeart, providing __Authentication__ and __Authorization__ capabilities. 

**restheart-security** is built around a __pluggable architecture__. It comes with a strong security implementation but you can easily extend it by implementing plugins. 

Building a plugin is as easy as implementing a simple interface and edit a configuration file. Plugins also allow to quickly implement and deploy secure Web Services.
